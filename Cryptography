Cryptosystem == pair of algorithms [encryption/decryption of data].Generating and shareing the key [in secret] is a part
of cryptosystem. Used in order to send the message in a secure through the internet [online & locally]. 
The Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] is used by the governments to maintain to secure their documents which was chosen
from the many candidates across the mathematics. 

Plaintext == The original message in its original legible form.

Ciphertext == Encrypted text that will appear to be a random string.

Encryption == Process of converting data from the cryptic which prevents unauthorized access [converting plaintext to 
ciphertext]. The key required to provide information for the implementation of the encryption algorithm.

Decription == Converting encrypted data into original  which requires decryption key to provide information to 'undo'
the encryption.
